Credit Risk Analysis ReportThe purpose of this credit risk analysis is to assess the performance of a machine learning model in predicting creditworthiness for loan applicants. The model aims to differentiate between healthy loans (class 0) and high-risk loans (class 1). The analysis provides insights into the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the model to evaluate its effectiveness in making reliable predictions.Model Performance Metrics Model 1:Accuracy: 0.99Precision:Class 0: 1.00Class 1: 0.84Recall:Class 0: 0.99Class 1: 0.90F1-Score:Class 0: 1.00Class 1: 0.87Model 2:Accuracy: 0.95Precision:Class 0: 0.92Class 1: 0.99Recall:Class 0: 1.00Class 1: 0.91F1-Score:Class 0: 0.95Class 1: 0.95Model 1:Model 1 is generally accurate, with a minor trade-off between precision and recall for high-risk loans. Recommended for consideration, with a suggestion for further investigation into the consequences of false positives.Model 2:Demonstrates balanced and reliable performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall for both healthy and high-risk loans. Recommended for use by the company in credit risk analysis.In conclusion, while both models exhibit strong performance, Model 2 is recommended for use by the company due to its balanced precision and recall scores for both healthy and high-risk loans. It provides a reliable and well-rounded solution for credit risk assessment.
